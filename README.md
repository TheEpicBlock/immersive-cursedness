# Immersive Cursedness

Have you ever used Immersive Portals and thought *this isn't cursed enough*? Then this mod is for you!
It uses advanced cursedness to deliver immersiveness straight to the client. And uses packet spam to ensure clients don't even have to install the mod themselves!

*Disclaimer  
This mod uses multithreading, whilst I'm reasonably sure I don't use it in a way that causes issues, keep in mind that it hasn't been extensively tested.*
